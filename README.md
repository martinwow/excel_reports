# excel_reports

These are projects I created for automatic reporting at the office. Alfa_costs contains a simple SQL query, which is stored into a pandas dataFrame. This is modified with some corrections (original dataFrame is kept unchanged so that it can be compared with the modified one). Finally, the modified version of the dataFrame is exported into an Excel template file and solved with a custom name, depended on the month of the report.
